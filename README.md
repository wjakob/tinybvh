# TinyBVH
Single-header BVH construction and traversal library written in C++14 / "Sane C++" (or "C with classes"). C++17 is used for threading. **This library has no dependencies.** 

TinyBVH is _fast_. Here is, in a nutshell, how it compares to [Intel's Embree](https://www.embree.org) and [Madmann91's BVH library](https://github.com/madmann91/bvh).
![Performance](images/perfgraphs.png)
TinyBVH currently builds a SAH BVH faster than Embree and Maddmann91. It also traces individual primary and 'any hit' rays faster than those libraries. Note: These results are based on the new ````tiny_bvh_benchmark.cpp```` application and are cautiously presented as 'preliminary'. Note that single-ray traversal is only a small part of Embree. If you suspect an inperfection in the experiment setup, please [let me know](mailto:bikker.j@protonmail.com).
![Performance](images/cpu_vs_gpu.png)
When tracing rays on the GPU, (multicore) CPU performance is dwarfed. On an RTX 5080 laptop GPU, TinyBVH traces up to _4 billion rays_ per second in Crytek's Sponza scene using the basic binary BVH format, regardless of graphics API and without using specialized ray tracing hardware. That is 4 rays per pixel at 4k@120Hz, enough for most purposes.
# TinyOCL
TinyBVH GPU ray traversal examples are available for OpenCL and OpenGL with compute shaders. For OpenCL support, TinyOCL is provided: a single-header OpenCL library, which helps you select and initialize a compute device. It also loads, compiles and runs kernels, with several convenient features:
* Include-file expansion for AMD devices
* Multi-argument passing
* Host/device buffer management
* Vendor and architecture detection and propagation to #defines in OpenCL code
* ..and many other things.

![Bistro](images/combined.jpg)

To use TinyOCL, just include ````tiny_ocl.h````; this will automatically cause linking with ````OpenCL.lib```` in the 'external' folder, which in turn passes on work to vendor-specific driver code.

Note that the ````tiny_bvh.h```` library will work without ````tiny_ocl.h```` and remains dependency-free. The new ````tiny_ocl.h```` is only needed in projects that wish to trace rays on the GPU using BVHs created by ````tiny_bvh.h````.
  
# BVH?
A Bounding Volume Hierarchy is a data structure used to quickly find intersections in a virtual scene; most commonly between a ray and a group of triangles. You can read more about this in a series of articles on the subject: https://jacco.ompf2.com/2022/04/13/how-to-build-a-bvh-part-1-basics .

To build a BVH using TinyBVH, simply call ````BVH::Build```` on an instantiated ````BVH````. See [````tiny_bvh_minimal.cpp````](https://github.com/jbikker/tinybvh/blob/dev/examples/tiny_bvh_minimal.cpp) for a (really) small example.
Internally, the call is forwarded to a specialized builder. There are fast builders, builders for 'high quality' BVHs and experimental builders for research and development. 

A selection:
* ````BVH::Build```` : Efficient plain-C/C+ binned SAH BVH builder which should run on any platform.
* ````BVH::BuildAVX```` : A highly optimized version of BVH::Build for Intel and AMD CPUs. 
* ````BVH::BuildHQ```` : A 'spatial splits' BVH builder, for optimal BVH quality.

A constructed BVH can be used to intersect a ray with geometry, using ````BVH::Intersect```` or ````BVH::IsOccluded````, for shadow (aka _any hit_) rays.

Apart from the default BVH layout (simply named ````BVH````), several other layouts are available, which all serve one or more specific purposes. You can create a BVH in the desired layout by instantiating the appropriate class. The available layouts are:
* ````BVH```` : A compact format that stores the AABB for a node, along with child pointers and leaf information in a cross-platform-friendly way. The 32-byte size allows for cache-line alignment.
* ````BVH_Double```` : Double-precision version of ````BVH````.
* ````BVH4_Double```` : Double-precision version of ````BVH4_CPU````, with AVX2 and NEON traversal kernels.
* ````MBVH<M>```` : In this (templated) format, each node stores _M_ child pointers, reducing the depth of the tree. This improves performance for divergent rays. Based on the [2008 paper](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~boulos/papers/multi_rt08.pdf) by Ingo Wald et al.
* ````BVH4_CPU```` : SSE/NEON-optimized wide BVH traversal (["WiVe"](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hamann/FuetterlingLojewskiPfreundtHamannEbertHPG2017PaperFinal06222017.pdf)). The fastest option for CPUs that do not support AVX.
* ````BVH8_CPU```` : AVX2/NEON-optimized wide BVH traversal (["WiVe"](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~hamann/FuetterlingLojewskiPfreundtHamannEbertHPG2017PaperFinal06222017.pdf)). This is the fastest option on CPU.
* ````BVH_GPU```` : This format uses 64 bytes per node and stores the AABBs of the two child nodes. This is the format presented in the [2009 Aila & Laine paper](https://research.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/pubs/2009-08_Understanding-the-Efficiency/aila2009hpg_paper.pdf). It can be traversed with a simple GPU kernel.
* ````BVH4_GPU```` : A compact version of the ````BVH4```` format, which may be faster for GPU ray tracing.
* ````BVH8_CWBVH```` : An advanced 80-byte representation of the 8-wide BVH, for state-of-the-art GPU rendering, based on the [2017 paper](https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2017-07_efficient-incoherent-ray-traversal-gpus-through-compressed-wide-bvhs) by Ylitie et al. and [code by AlanWBFT](https://github.com/AlanIWBFT/CWBVH).

A BVH in any format can be _rebuilt_ at any time by calling the ````Build```` method on the changed triangle data. A BVH may also be _refitted_, in case the triangles moved, using ````BVH::Refit````. Refitting is substantially faster than rebuilding and works well if the animation is subtle. Refitting does not work if polygon counts change.

Most layouts may be serialized and de-serialized via ````::Save```` and ````::Load````.

TinyBVH also supports construction of a _Top-Level Acceleration Structure_ (TLAS). The TLAS is a BVH over _Bottom-Level Acceleration Structures_ (BLASses), where each BLAS is a BVH, with a 4x4 matrix transform. Different layouts can be combined under a single TLAS. The TLAS can be used for cheap _rigid animation_ (by changing the transforms) as well as instancing.

A more complete overview of TinyBVH functionality can be found in the [Basic Use Manual](https://jacco.ompf2.com/2025/01/24/tinybvh-manual-basic-use) and the [Advanced Topics Manual](https://jacco.ompf2.com/2025/01/25/tinybvh-manual-advanced).

# How To Use
The library consists of ````tiny_bvh.h```` and the ````tiny_bvh_*.h```` headers next to it; keep them together and include only ````tiny_bvh.h````. It is designed to be easy to use. Please have a look at [````tiny_bvh_minimal.cpp````](https://github.com/jbikker/tinybvh/blob/dev/examples/tiny_bvh_minimal.cpp) for an example. A Visual Studio 'solution' (.sln/.vcxproj) is included, as well as a CMake file. That being said: Most examples consists of only a single source file, which can be compiled with clang or g++, e.g.:

````g++ examples/tiny_bvh_minimal.cpp````

The cross-platform fenster-based single-source **bitmap renderer** can be compiled with

````g++ -mwindows -O3 examples/tiny_bvh_fenster.cpp -o tiny_bvh_fenster```` (on Linux and Windows)

````c++ --std=c++17 -framework Cocoa -O3 examples/tiny_bvh_fenster.cpp -o tiny_bvh_fenster```` (on macOS)

The multi-threaded **path tracing** demo can be compiled with

````g++ -mwindows -O3 examples/tiny_bvh_pt.cpp -o tiny_bvh_pt```` (on Linux and Windows)

````c++ --std=c++17 -framework Cocoa -O3 examples/tiny_bvh_pt.cpp -o tiny_bvh_pt```` (on macOS)

The **performance measurement tool** can be compiled with:

````g++ -mavx2 -mfma -Ofast tiny_bvh_speedtest.cpp -o tiny_bvh_speedtest```` (on Linux and Windows)

````c++ --std=c++17 -framework OpenCL -Ofast tiny_bvh_speedtest.cpp -o tiny_bvh_speedtest```` (on macOS)

Note: A new, more advanced benchmark tool is now available. See [build.bat](https://github.com/jbikker/tinybvh/blob/dev/build.bat) and [build_debug.bat](https://github.com/jbikker/tinybvh/blob/dev/build_debug.bat) for an example of a commandline to compile it using gcc.

Many [additional demos](https://github.com/jbikker/tinybvh/blob/dev/examples) are provided, demonstrating features of the library in small source files.

# Version 1.8.1

Basic use:

````
BVH bvh;
bvh.Build( (bvhvec4*)myTriData, triangleCount ); // or: BuildHQ( .. )
bvh.Intersect( ray );
````

To build a BVH for indexed vertices, use the new indexed interface:

````
BVH bvh;
bvh.Build( (bvhvec4*)vertices, (uint32_t*)indices, triangleCount );
````

If you wish to use a specific builder (such as the spatial splits builder) or if you need to do custom operations on the BVH, such as post-build optimizing, you can still do the conversions manually. Example:

````
BVH bvh;
bvh.Build( verts, indices, triCount );
BVH_Verbose tmp;
tmp.ConvertFrom( bvh );
tmp.Optimize( 100 );
bvh.ConvertFrom( tmp );
printf( "Optimized BVH SAH cost: %f\n", bvh.SAHCost() );
````

Note that in this case, data ownership and lifetime must be managed carefully. Specifically, layouts converted from other layouts use data from the original, so both must be kept alive.

**New in 1.7.3:** BVH build settings are now in ````BVHBase::settings````:
````
struct BVHBuildSettings
{
    bool usePresplitting = false;	// pre-split triangles before building the BVH.
    bool useSpatialSplits = false;	// consider spatial splits during construction (SBVH).
    bool presplitPostPass = true;	// attempt to un-split primitives in leafs after a presplit build.
    float presplitFactor = 0.3f;	// presplit budget relative to input data size.
    bool useFullSweep = false;		// for experiments only; full-sweep SAH builder.
    bool postOptimize = false;		// optimize generated BVH using tree rotations.
    int optimizeIterations = 25;	// default optimization iterations.
    bool useSIMDifavailable = true;	// set to false to use the scalar reference builder.
};
````   
This supersedes the calls to ````::BuildHQ```` and ````::BuildAVX````, which are now invoked from ````::Build```` based on the hints in ````BVHBuildSettings````. The old interface also remains available for now.

# Platforms
TinyBVH is a cross-platfrom library and should build on any platform that supports C++20 (the '20' bit is for threading). That being said, several platforms are specifically supported:
* ````x86/x64 Windows/Linux````: These platforms benefit from highly optimized SSE/AVX/AVX2 traversal kernels.
* ````OPENCL````: Although TinyBVH does not directly use OpenCL, GPU-specific BVHs can be constructed and example code for BLAS/TLAS traversal in OpenCL is provided.
* ````OpenGL/compute````: Example compute shader code for BLAS traversal is also provided.
* ````ARM_NEON````: Efficient BVH construction code is provided for ARM NEON. The ````BVH_SoA```` and ````BVH4_CPU```` layouts use NEON intrinsics for fast traversal.
* ````ANDROID````: This platform benefits from ARM NEON support as well as aligned memory allocation.
* ````APPLE````: This platform benefits from ARM NEON support, dedicated paths in GPU example code and specialized support in TinyBVH itself.
